			A third party website for the game Hordes.io developed to help its players auction off items
			instead of listing them for a flat price on the ingame store. Due to poor planning on my part
			it had a number of issues. Because of that, as well as some personal problems, I shut it down
			after a couple of months.

			An idle game that I started working on back in high school. Only has like 10 minutes worth of
			content because I eventually realized that I had no actual plan for the game. As such, it
			didn't really go anywhere. Regardless, it was my first real attempt at web development and
			certainly taught me a lot.

			The (old) Discord bot for the Hordes.io Discord server. Nothing too fancy, but we used it for
